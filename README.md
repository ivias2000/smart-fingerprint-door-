## Overview  
This project implements a **smart door access system** using Arduino. The system integrates a **fingerprint sensor**, **servo motor (door lock)**, **LCD display**, **RTC (real-time clock)**, and **EEPROM** for logging entry/exit events. It identifies users, grants access, and stores timestamped logs for security tracking.  

##  Features  
 **Fingerprint Authentication** – Users are identified with an Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor.  
 **Real-Time Clock (RTC)** – Logs accurate entry/exit time and date using DS1307.  
 **EEPROM Logging** – Stores user ID, action (IN/OUT), and timestamp in external EEPROM.  
 **LCD Display** – Provides real-time feedback (welcome messages, gate status, errors).  
 **Servo Motor Control** – Opens/closes the gate automatically on authentication.  
 **Multiple Users** – Example includes *Mahdi* and *Ali*, with separate IN/OUT tracking.  
 **Communication Protocols** – Utilizes I²C, UART, and GPIO for system integration.  

##  Hardware Requirements  
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)  
- LCD1602 display (with I²C or parallel connection)  
- Servo motor (for door lock)  
- Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor  
- RTC module (DS1307)  
- EEPROM (AT24Cxx series, e.g. AT24C512)  
- Breadboard, jumper wires, power supply  

##  Libraries Used  
Make sure to install these libraries in Arduino IDE:  
- `LiquidCrystal`  
- `Servo`  
- `SoftwareSerial`  
- `Adafruit_Fingerprint`  
- `RTClib`  
- `AT24Cxx`  

##  Setup & Installation

How It Works

System starts and initializes modules (Fingerprint, RTC, EEPROM, LCD).

User places a finger on the sensor.

If recognized:

Displays Welcome <Name> on LCD.

Logs user ID, IN/OUT status, and timestamp in EEPROM.

Opens servo-controlled gate for 5 seconds.

If not recognized:

Displays Finger Not Found on LCD.

 Example Log Data (EEPROM)
User ID	Action	Date	Time
1 (Mahdi)	IN	2024/12/08	14:30:12
2 (Ali)	OUT	2024/12/08	14:45:50
 Future Improvements

Support for more users with names stored in EEPROM.

Web or mobile app integration for remote monitoring.

SD card logging for larger history.

WiFi/IoT connectivity (ESP8266/ESP32).
